## Persistent identifiers

Identifiers are a long-lasting references to a digital resources such as datasets and provides the information required to reliably identify, verify and locate your research data. Commonly, a persistent identifier is a unique record ID in a database, or unique URL that takes a researcher to the data in question, in a database.

That resource might be a publication, dataset, or person.   Persistent The identifiers have to be unique, globally only your data are identified by this ID that is never used by anyone in the whole world. In addition, these IDs and must not do not become invalid over time.
Watch our RDMbBites on the persistent identifiers to understand more.   

Identifiers are very important concept of the FAIR principle. They are considered one of the pillars for the FAIR principles. It makes your data more **Findable (F)**

## Find the PID
Remember our example on metadata types from arrayexpress [here](https://saramorsy.github.io/FAIR/02-ep.html), can you tell what is the persistent identifier of this dataset?

:::: solution
The PID in this case or as it called in array express "Accession" is **E-MTAB-7933**. If you use this accession number, you will find the dataset. 
**In addition, have you noticed that also the data files are named using this PID** .

**It is important to note that when you upload your data to a public repository, the repository will create this ID for you automatically.**

## the Structure of persistent identifiers

As you can see in this picture, the structure of any identifiers consist of 
1- The initial resolver service: domain which is unique and specific to each community e.g. ORCID for researchers and DOI for publications
2- **Prefix**: Unique number that represent category e.g. for DOI specific numbers refer to the publisher and directory
3- **Suffix**: The unique dataset number and it is unique under its prefix

[The structure of persistent identifiers as in DOI, In the prefix, you can see that first part of prefix represent DOI directory and the following number is publisher. Suffix is unique under its unique prefix](fig/img18.jpg)

## Resources
The resources listed below provide an overview of the information you need to know about identifiers.
- [Unique and persistent identifiers](https://faircookbook.elixir-europe.org/content/recipes/findability/identifiers.html): this link provide a nice and practical explanation of the unique and persistent identifiers from FAIRCookbook 

- [Identifiers](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/identifiers.html): another nice explanation from RDMkit

- [Machine actionability](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/machine_actionability): identifiers are also important for machine readability, a nice explanation from RDMkit that describes machine readability

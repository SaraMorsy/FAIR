## Objectives

1- To illustrate what is the communications protocol  

2- To articulate  what are the criteria for open and free protocol

3- To relate to the quote “As open as possible as close as necessary” by giving examples on sensitive data

3- To give examples of  databases that uses a protocol with   different  authentication process 

4- To interpret the usage licence associated with different data sets

<p style="text-align: center;"> Standard communication protocol </p>

(A1)   	(meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol

Simply put, **a protocol** is a method that connects two computers, the protocol ensure security, and authenticity of your data. Once the safety and authenticity of the data is verified, the transfer of data to another computer happens.

Having a protocol does not guarantee that your data are accessible. However, you can choose a protocol that is free, open and allow easy and exchange of information. One of the steps you can do is to choose the right database, so when you upload your data into database, the database executes a protocol that allows the user to  load data in the user’s web browser. This protocol allows the easy access of the data but still secures the data.

## Authentication process
It is the process that a protocol uses for verification. To know what authentication is, suppose we have three people named John Smith. We do not know which one submitted the data. This is through assigning a unique ID for each one that is interpreted by machines and humans so you would know who is the actual person that submitted the data. Doing so is a form of authentication. This is used by many databases like Zenodo, where you can sign-up using ORCID-ID allowing the database to identify you.

## Resources
- A nice recipe from FAIRcookbook on [SSH protocols](https://faircookbook.elixir-europe.org/content/recipes/accessibility/sftp.html)
- A nice explanation from RDMkit on protocols and how they will help you protect your data[Protocols and safety of data transfer](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/data_transfer.html)

## Exercise
After reading this guide on different [protocol types](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/data_transfer.html#how-do-you-transfer-large-data-files), give an example on one of databases that uses one of these protocols?

<p style="text-align: center;"> Data usage licence </p>


**(R1.1)	meta(data) are released with a clear and accessible data usage licence**

This describes the legal rights on how others use your data. As you publish your data, you should describe clearly in what capacity your data can be used. Bear in mind that description of licence is important to allow machine and human reusability of your data. There are many licence that can be used e.g. MIT licence or Common creative licence. These licences provide accurate description of the rights of data reuse, Please have a look at resources in the description box to know more about these licences.

Having your work licenced does not sound simple as it seems; here are some resources to help you find the correct licence for you:

## Exercise
- From the previous resources that we provided, what is the licence used by the following datasets:
1- [A large-scale COVID-19 Twitter chatter dataset for open scientific research - an international collaboration](https://zenodo.org/record/7368547#.Y4TjT3bP02w)
2- [RNA-seq of circadian timeseries sampling (LL2-3) of 13-14 day old Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 (24 h to 68 h, sampled every 4 h)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/studies/E-MTAB-7933)

<p style="text-align: center;"> Sensitive data </p>

Sensitive data are data that, if made publicly available, could cause consequences for individuals, groups, nations, or ecosystems and need to be secured from unauthorised access. To determine whether your data is sensitive, you should consult national laws, which vary by country.
Through the following resources, you will know more about sensitive data and what to do if your data is  sensitive

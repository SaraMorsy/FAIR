## Objectives
1- To identify what are metadata and its types

3- To take part in understanding what are the community standards and how to use them for data and metadata

4- To define what is data provenance

5- To illustrate what is rich metadata and how to use them

6- To explain how to explicitly use rich metadata to describe your data
:::

## Meta-data

Metadata is the descriptions of your data.  In a simple words, if we had a data file such as an Excel spreadsheet containing data values for an assay, column headings are used to assign meaning and context.  Here the data itself are the data values, and the metadata are the column headings. Any documentation or explanation of the excel file that accompanies it, is likewise considered metadata.

As a researchers you would deal with bigger and larger datasets where metadata can also relate to provenance and include a description of the assay or the person performing the data.  So, the more metadata that is given, the more context is supplied to someone reusing a data set.

#### What else would metadata reveal?
Metadata can describe a variety of things, including your data's characteristics and data provenance, which explains how your data was created. There are three types of metadata: descriptive, structural, and administrative.  

- **Descriptive Metadata** describes the characteristics of the dataset so for instance authors, abstracts, and any relevant publication.
- **Structural metadata** describes how it is generated, and how it is internally structured.
- **Administrative metadata** describes who managed the data, collaborators and project funds.  

::: discussion
## Identify types of metadata in this microarray dataset
let’s see this example on microarray data from a database called gene omnibus database (GEO). In this dataset, you will find the data, metadata, and persistent identifier (PID). In the black circle, you will find the data identifier (ID) which is unique and persistent to the data. For metadata, you will find the administrative metadata in the orange square. You will also find the descriptive metadata in the orange square, as you can see, it describes the author, publication and abstract for the study. For the structural metadata, it is described in the files (orange arrows). Also, you can find the data here (green arrow)

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge
- After reading the guide on [types to metadata](https://carpentries-incubator.github.io/fair-bio-practice/05-intro-to-metadata/index.html), Can you determine what are the types of metadata in this dataset [E-MTAB-7933](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/studies/E-MTAB-7933)?
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

<p style="text-align: center;"> Metadata and data are always available </p>

**(A2) Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available**

The maintenance of the data sets in the public database comes at a cost. This can be avoided by maintenance of the metadata instead. Metadata is small and can be easily maintained not only on the database but personal computer of researchers. This also the case for sensitive data where the metadata are available and provides contact details of the researchers, how to get the data and data provenance


:::::::::::::: challenge
- After reading previous resources, you should have an idea on metadata, would you give an example of metadata without data?
:::::::::::::::::

<p style="text-align: center;"> Data and metadata should follow Community standards </p>

Each data type has its own community that creates criteria to ensure that metadata and data are described appropriately. When describing your data, make sure to adhere to the community standards. This is critical as your data becomes more trustworthy. If you decide to utilise other criteria, make sure you document this clearly. The use of community standards will not only allow your data to be reused, but it will also be easily interoperable across multiple platforms.
We provide samples of various community standards that you may use to ensure that your data is described using the right descriptors.

## Exercise
In the light of previous resources, Could you know what will be the appropriate storage for bioimaging data?
:::

<p style="text-align: center;"> Provenance </p>

**Provenance** is the detailed description of the history of the data and how it is generated.
Here is an example from GEO database where there is accurate description of the data which allow the reusability of microarray data. As you see, there is rich description of the study design, organism, platform and description of data. The user can reuse the data safely as the decryption of the data and metadata allows accurate reusability of the data. Also, attachment to this dataset, there are files that allow machine readability of these metadata that can be read by software packages like R.

::: 

<p style="text-align: center;"> Vocabularies are FAIR </p>
(I2)  (meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles
(I1)  (meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation


The metadata and data should be described by vocabularies that comply with FAIR which means that metadata and data should be:
**F** globally unique and persistent identifiers                           
**A** accessible documentation that extensively describes your identifiers
**I** Vocabularies are interoperable
**R** Can be reused and interpreted easily by humans and machines

<p style="text-align: center;"> Linked metadata </p>
(I3)  (meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data

When uploading your dataset to any database, you should include the following information:
1- Additional datasets that supplement your data
2- It should be stated if your dataset is built on another dataset.

:::

Usually, when the data is generated, both metadata and data files are separate files. As a researcher, you should ensure that both files refer to each other.

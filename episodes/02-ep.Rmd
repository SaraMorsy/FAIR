## Objectives
1- To identify what are metadata and its types

3- To take part in understanding what are the community standards and how to use them for data and metadata

4- To define what is data provenance

5- To illustrate what is rich metadata and how to use them

6- To explain how to explicitly use rich metadata to describe your data

## Meta-data

Metadata is the descriptions of your data.  In a simple words, if we had a data file such as an Excel spreadsheet containing data values for an assay, column headings are used to assign meaning and context.  Here the data itself are the data values, and the metadata are the column headings 

As a researchers you would deal with bigger and larger datasets where metadata can also relate to provenance and include a description of the assay or the person performing the data.  So, the more metadata that is given, the more context is supplied to someone reusing a data set.


#### what can metadata describe?

metadata can describe data provenance which describes how your data is produced, and it can also describe the characteristics of your data.  
There are three types of metadata: descriptive, structural, and administrative.  

- **Descriptive Metadata** describes the characteristics of the dataset so for instance authors, abstracts, and any relevant publication.
- **Structural metadata** describes how it is generated, and how it is internally structured.
- **Administrative metadata** describes who managed the data, collaborators and project funds.  


::: discussion
## Identify types of metadata in this microarray dataset
let’s see this example on microarray data from a database called GEO (gene omnibus database). In this dataset, you will find the data, metadata, and PID. In the black circle, you will find the data ID which is unique and persistent to the data. For metadata, you will find the administrative metadata in the orange square. You will also find the descriptive metadata in the orange square, as you can see, it describes the author, publication and abstract for the study. For the structural metadata, it is described in the files (orange arrows). Also, you can find the data here (green arrow)

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge
- From the following resources, Can you determine what are the types of metadata in this dataset [E-MTAB-7933](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/studies/E-MTAB-7933)?
:::::::::::::::: solution
once discussed
::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

<p style="text-align: center;"> Metadata and data are always available </p>

**(A2)** Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available

The maintenance of the data sets in the public database comes at a cost. his can be avoided by maintenance of the metadata instead. As a result, over the time, many data sets are lost. Metadata is small and can be easily maintained not only on the database but personal computer of researchers. This also the case for sensitive data where the metadata are available and provides contact details of the researchers, how to get the data and data provenance


:::::::::::::: challenge
- From the previous resources: would you give an example of metadata without data?
:::::::::::::::::

<p style="text-align: center;"> Data and metadata should follow Community standards </p>

When you describe your data, make sure you follow the guidelines of the community standards. This is important as your data is more reliable to use. If you decide to use different standard, make sure you explain this in clear documentation. Use of the community standards will not only allow reusability of your data but it will be easily interoperable across different platforms. 
Here we give you examples of different community standards where you can check to describe your data using the appropriate descriptors. More resources are available [here](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/your_domain)

## Exercise
Based on the previous resources, Could you know what will be the appropriate repository suitable for bioimaging data?
:::

<p style="text-align: center;"> Provenance </p>

Provenance is the detailed description of the history of the data and how it is generated.
Here is an example from GEO database where there is accurate description of the data which allow the reusability of microarray data. As you see, there is rich description of the study design, organism, platform and description of data. The user can reuse the data safely as the decryption of the data and metadata allows accurate reusability of the data. Also, attachment to this dataset, there are files that allow machine readability of these metadata that can be read by software packages like R.

::: 

<p style="text-align: center;"> Vocabularies are FAIR </p>
(I2)  (meta)data use vocabularies that follow FAIR principles
(I1)  (meta)data use a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation


The metadata and data should be described by vocabularies that comply with FAIR which means
**F** globally unique and persistent identifiers                           
**A** accessible documentation that extensively describes your identifiers
**I** Vocabularies are interoperable
**R** Can be reused and interpreted easily by humans and machines

You can read here in our resources how you can describe your data with FAIR vocabularies and formal language for knowledge representation

<p style="text-align: center;"> Linked metadata </p>
(I3)  (meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data

As a result, over the time, many datasets are lost. Metadata is small and can be easily maintained not only on the database but personal computer of researchers. This also the case for sensitive data where the metadata are available and provides contact details of the researchers, how to get the data and data provenance

Usually, when the data is generated, both metadata and data files are separate files. As a researcher, you should ensure that both files refer to each other.

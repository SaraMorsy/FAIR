## Objectives
1- To explain the definition and importance of using identifiers

2- To illustrate what are the persistent identifiers

3- To use Persistent identifiers not only for data but also for metadata

4- To give examples of the structure of persistent identifiers

5- To define why to keep metadata available even after loss of the data

### Persistent identifiers

**(F1)** (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier

Identifiers are a long-lasting references to a digital resources such as datasets and provides the information required to reliably identify, verify and locate your research data. Commonly, a persistent identifier is a unique record ID in a database, or unique URL that takes a researcher to the data in question, in a database.
 
That resource might be a publication, dataset, or person.   Persistent The identifiers have to be unique, globally only your data are identified by this ID that is never used by anyone in the whole world. In addition, these IDs and must not do not become invalid over time.
Watch our RDMbBites on the persistent identifiers to understand more.   

**It is important to note that when you upload your data to a public repository, the repository will create this ID for you automatically.**

## Exercise
- From the following resources, Can you give example of persistent identifiers that fulfill the criteria of being globally unique and persistent?
- What is minting identifiers? #(I want to remove this)
- [Using Datastewardship wizard](https://researchers.ds-wizard.org/knowledge-models/dsw:root:latest/preview?questionUuid=d21fdb06-22bf-418e-aa40-dc5ef1485f56), Can you identify the main points you can use to describe this dataset [E-MTAB-7933](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biostudies/arrayexpress/studies/E-MTAB-7933)?

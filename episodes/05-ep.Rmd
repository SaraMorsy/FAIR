## Outcomes
1- Define what is data repository?

2- Illustrate different types of data repository

3- Summarize steps of data indexing in a searchable repository

## Indexed data repository

To ensure data findability, your data should be uploaded to a public repository where your data can be searched and found, which is why F4 is so vital. There are numerous databases where you can upload your data, these are typically data-driven. 
Examples of these databases are **Arrayexpress** for microarray data and RNAseq data. These databases have set of rules in place to make sure that your data will be FAIR.

After you upload your data into this database, they are assigned an ID and are indexed in the database. So whenever you look for the ID, or even use a keyword for your data, you will find your data.

Take a look at the **ArrayExpress** database where all datasets are indexed, and you can simply find any dataset using the search tools. By indexing data, you can get the dataset using any keyword other than the PID. For example, if you want to locate human NSCL cell lines, you can just type this into the search toolbox and find the dataset. Indexing and registering datasets , also means they are curated in such a way that you may discover them using different keywords.


::::::: challenge
One of the things you can do to index your dataset, is to upload it to Zenodo, Can you use one of the resources we recommended before to know how to do this?

1- [RDMkit](https://rdmkit.elixir-europe.org/)

2- [FAIRcookbook](https://faircookbook.elixir-europe.org/)

3- [FAIRsharing](https://fairsharing.org/)

:::: solution
Since you want a technical guideline, FAIRcookbook and RDMkit are the best to start with. We will start with [FAIRcookbook](https://faircookbook.elixir-europe.org/)
As we explained before the structure of the recipe so let's look for the suitable recipe in the FAIRcookbook
So as you navigate the homepage of FAIRcookbook, you will find different tabs that covers each of FAIR principles, so for instance, if you want recipes on **Accessibility** of FAIR, you will find all recipes that can help you make your data accessible. 

- **Follow the following steps to find the recipe:**

1- In this exercise, we are looking for a recipe on **indexing or registering dataset in a searchable resource** which you can find it in the findability tab, **Can you find it in this picture?**
![Recipes of FAIRcookbook where you will find different recipes for FAIR, infrastructure, assessment and maturity models](fig/img51.png)

2- Click on the findability tab

3- on the left side, you will find a navigation bar which will help you find different recipes that make your data **findable**. 
![You can find on the left sie the list of recipes to make your data findable](fig/img52.png)

4- As you can see here, you will find a recipe on registering datasets with Wikidata and another one on depositing to generic repositories-Zenodo use case

**Once you click on one of these resources, you will find the following:**

A) Requirements that you need to apply the recipe to your dataset
B) The instructions 
C) References and further readings
B) Authors and licence
![Zenodo use case where you will get step by step guideline on how to deposit your data to Zenodo](fig/img53.png)

In our specialized courses, we will give you examples on how to upload your data to specialized repository

::: discussion
### Why should you upload your data to a database?
1- Databases assign your data a unique persistent identifier.

2- Your data will be indexed, making it easier to find.

3- Some databases will let you easily connect your dataset to other datasets.

4- Dataset licencing, with some databases offering controlled or limited access to protect your data.

**By uploading data to a database, you comply with the following FAIR principles**

**F1** (Meta)data are assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier

**F3** Metadata clearly and explicitly include the identifier of the data they describe

**F4** (Meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource

It will also allow your data to be more accessible as the standardized communications protocol and authentication is automatically set for your data

**A1** (Meta)data are retrievable by their identifier using a standardised communications protocol

A1.1 The protocol is open, free, and universally implementable

A1.2 The protocol allows for an authentication and authorisation procedure, where necessary

**A2** Metadata are accessible, even when the data are no longer available

**I3** (Meta)data include qualified references to other (meta)data

**R1.1** (Meta)data are released with a clear and accessible data usage license
:::

#### How to choose the right database for your dataset?

1- Check the community standards for your data

2- Look for resources that describe the databases and check if it fits your data, you might consider the following:

A) Accessibility options 

B) Licence

One of these resources is **FAIRsharing**, *it provides a registry for different databases and repositories. Here is an example where the FAIR sharing provides you with information regarding protein database [here](https://fairsharing.org/FAIRsharing.rtndct). It has the following information

1- General information

2- Which policies that use this database?

3- Related community standards

4- Organization maintaing this database

5- Documentation and support

6- Licence

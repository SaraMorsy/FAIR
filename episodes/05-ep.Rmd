<p style="text-align: center;">Indexed data repository</p>

**(F4)** (meta)data are registered or indexed in a searchable resource

If your data has persitent and unique identif  are not adequate to fulfill the findability of the data without a public platform where your data can be researched, that is why F4 is important. There are a lot of different databases where you can upload your data. These are usually data specific. These databases provide indexing and unique identification of your data. Examples of these databases are Arrayexpress for microarray data and RNAseq data, Zinc database for the chemical molecules. These databases have set of rules in place to make sure that your data will be FAIR.

After you upload your data into this database, they are assigned an ID and are indexed in the database. So whenever you look for the ID, or even use a keyword for your data, you will find your data.

Our resources provide an overview of data repositories and examples.
